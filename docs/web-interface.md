# Web Interface

Users interact with RaDaR using the web interface. The web interface uses the
AngularJS framework. The code is kept in the `client` directory.

## Building

See [gulp.md](gulp.md).

## Browser Support

The web interface supports most modern browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox etc)
and Internet Explorer 8+.

At some point we will drop support for IE8 which will allow us to:

* Upgrade AngularJS to version 1.5
* Upgrade JQuery to version 2
