# XXX currently this results in "maximum call stack size exceeded"
# A workaround is to install each package separately.
# FIXME https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9224
# XXX imagemin will silently fail to build native binaries
# The symptom is that gulp build:dist will fail on the images step.
# The first issue is that the modules don't detect the system binaries for
# optipng, jpegtran, gifsicle etc.
# The second issue is that the module that downloads the source code doesn't
# respect proxy settings.
# So you'll need to downgrade bin-build: npm install bin-build@2.1.1
# Then run: npm rebuild
# jpegtran will still fail as it is using a https URL
